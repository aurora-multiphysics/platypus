# Getting Started

To assist new users in getting started with Platypus, we provide Docker containers
with Platypus pre-built (updated weekly) and build scripts for UKAEA users to
build and run on CSD3:

- [Run Platypus within a Docker container](installation/using_docker.md)
- [Build Platypus on CSD3 (UKAEA users)](installation/csd3_build.md)


!include installation/using_docker.md

!include installation/csd3_build.md
